            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>I am a Croatian-American graduate from the Ohio State University. In my professional career, I gained a range of administrative and project management experience in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. In all areas of life, I pride myself on being adaptable, creative, and a lifelong learner. These skills allow me to engage in any position or project with an open-mind and synthesized solutions that make sense for a given team. In my spare time, I love to engage with my creativity through visual and fiber arts.</p>
