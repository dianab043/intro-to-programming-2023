Diana Brnjic

About

I am a Croatian-American graduate from the Ohio State University. In my professional career, I gained a range of administrative and project management experience in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. In all areas of life, I pride myself on being adaptable, creative, and a lifelong learner. These skills allow me to engage in any position or project with an open-mind and synthesized solutions that make sense for a given team. In my spare time, I love to engage with my creativity through visual and fiber arts.

Experience

Currently, I work as a full-time administrative assistant to three associate deans at the Ohio State University, overseeing multiple archives, databases, and projects in the higher education world. In the tech sphere, I helped develop and streamline a Wordpress class portal for an astrology company, utilizing both Divi Builder and Keap/Infusionsoft.
